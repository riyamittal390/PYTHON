# '__name__' evaluates to the name of the module in python from where the program is ran.
# If the module is being run directly from the command line, the '__name__' is set to string "__main__". Thus, this behaviour is used to check whether the module is run directly or imported to another file.

def myFunc():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # If this code is directly executed by running the file its present in

    print("We are directly running this code")
    myFunc()
    print(__name__)
